    "description": "[i]The Birth of Venus[/i], painted by Sandro Botticelli in the 1480s, is one of the most famous paintings in the world: it is a celebrated work of art and the high point of a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It is also a commercial icon and a line mark of European Art.\n\nThe real subject of the painting and its meaning is a mystery under discussion. Over the centuries, many theories and interpretations have been developed, proving the complexity of this work of art. The composition of the painting is quite simple: in the center, there’s a figure of Venus, goddess of love, standing in a shell being washed up on a beach, blown there by two personifications of winds visible on the left, and welcomed by a maiden on the right. There is a contrast between the title of the work and what it represents: we do not see the moment of Venus’ birth. According to the myth, she was born from the foam of the sea, but the painting shows us the moment when she arrives on land. It is clear that the personifications of the winds are Zephyrus and Aura, one impetuous and the other moderate. But the figure of the girl is uncertain: she could be Spring, a subject dear to Botticelli, because her dress is full of flowers, or the personification of motherhood, or one of the Three Graces. She has branches of roses around her waist, and myrtle branches around her neck - sacred plants for Venus.\n\nThe painting is a masterpiece of linearity and harmonious design, clarity, and brightness of colors, which includes the use of gold in a lot of detail. We have to remember that the painting today is not as glorious it was initially. The colors were brighter, especially the greens of the trees, and the blue of the sky.\n\n[i]The Birth of Venus[/i] is a work of extraordinary innovation, from many points of view. First, it is a representation of a nude woman: this kind of subject was restricted during the Medieval ages - the only exception was an image of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Botticielli produced the image of a beautiful naked woman, with a gaze that is remarkably in direct engagement with the viewer. Next, there is the news of the mythological theme that in the 1480s was absolutely a new type of painting. Botticelli obviously read classical texts before painting it: for example, the Roman writer Plinio made the description of the painting by the Greek artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url] that showed Venus rising from the sea or a Homeric hymn that told about Zephyrus that blows his wind on Aphrodite. \n\nBut not only the classical world was the source of Botticelli's work. He depicted the scene with a solemnity that recalls a religious rite; the disposition of the characters and their gestures remind representations of the Baptism of Christ, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/the-baptism-of-christ]that of Verrocchio[/url], which Botticelli had certainly seen. This iconographic analogy alludes, perhaps, to a thematic analogy between the mythical birth of the goddess from the sea and the Christian birth of the soul from the water of Baptism.\n\nIt is highly probable that the work was commissioned by a member of the Medici family (perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, \"il Magnifico\"), although there is nothing written about the painting before 1550, when [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url] describes it in the Medici’s Villa of Castello, owned by the cadet branch of the Medici family since the mid-15th century. This hypothesis would seem to be born out by the orange trees in the painting, which are considered an emblem of the Medici dynasty, on account of the assonance between the family name and the name of the orange tree, which at the time was ‘[i]mala medica[/i]’.",

    "description": "One of the most iconic and recognizable paintings in the world is the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] (ca. 1503-1519) painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa’s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo’s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate. \n\nIt is thought that the sitter was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. For this reason, the painting is sometimes called [i]La Gioconda[/i]. The earliest identification of the painting was provided by the Renaissance art historian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url]. In Vasari’s 1550 biography of Leonardo, he wrote about the magnificent portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, which Leonardo worked on between 1503 and 1506. Many were skeptical of Vasari’s account; however, a 2005 discovery at the University of Heidelberg provided compelling new evidence that confirms Vasari’s assertion. In a volume written by the ancient philosopher Cicero from 1477, there was a handwritten marginal by Leonardo’s contemporary, the secretary and assistant to Niccolò Machiavelli, Agostino Vespucci. In the note dated October 1503, Vespucci praises Leonardo’s skill by comparing him to the Greek and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], and states that Leonardo is working on a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo.\n\nThe [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was the earliest example in Italian portraiture that portrayed the sitter in a half-length format. Leonardo presented a new artistic formula: the figure is shown at half-length sitting in armchair in front of a [i]loggia[/i] - a gallery or room with one or more open sides. The incorporation of the [i]loggia[/i] allowed Leonardo to present an imaginary landscape as the backdrop of the portrait. This significant innovation influenced Leonardo contemporaries: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] adopted the composition and pose in his portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506][i]Young Woman with Unicorn[/i][/url] (ca. 1506). Still it is important to note that Leonardo was indebted to Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly the portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling]Hans Memling[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/barbara-de-vlaenderberch-1475][i]Portrait of Barbara van Vlaendenbergh[/i][/url] (ca. 1470-1472) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474][i]Man with a Roman coin[/i][/url] (ca. 1480).\n\nLeonardo spent his final years in France, where his patron the King of France, Francis I, purchased [i]Mona Lisa[/i] for the royal French collection. From 1797, the portrait is on permanent display at the Louvre and is the crown jewel of the museum collection. On the morning of August 22 1911, Louvre employees were shocked to discover that the painting was stolen the previous night. Two years later, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia was identified as the thief. Peruggia claimed his motives were patriotic: he believed Leonardo’s masterpiece belonged in Italy and was caught trying to sell the painting in Florence. After its discovery, the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was exhibited throughout Italy before its celebratory return to the Louvre in 1914.",

    "description": "The Scream is the best known and most frequently reproduced of all Munch’s motifs. With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.\r\n\r\nDespite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all.\r\n\r\nAs with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”.\r\n\r\nThe Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.\r\n",

This painting is one in which Klimt deviated from his portrayal of dominant in women in the form of a femme fatale. Instead is the portrayal of love and art, a couple locked in a golden-flecked, flower-filled embrace. Klimt was a man with an unbridled sexual appetite, as he fathered at least 14 illegitimate children. It is rumored that Klimt and his longtime companion, Emile Floge, who was also said to be his lover, were the models of the painting, which was selected to be printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin, minted in 2003.

    "description": "[i]The Persistence of Memory[/i] (1931) is one of the most iconic and recognizable paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. Frequently referenced in popular culture, the small canvas (24x33 cm) is sometimes known as “Melting Clocks”, “The Soft Watches” and “The Melting Watches”. The painting depicts a dreamworld in which common objects are deformed and displayed in a bizarre and irrational way: watches, solid and hard objects appear to be inexplicably limp and melting in the desolate landscape. Dalí paints his fantastical vision in a meticulous and realistic manner: he effortlessly integrates the real and the imaginary in order “to systemize confusion and thus to help discredit completely the world of reality”.\n \nWhen asked about the limp watches, the artist compared their softness to overripe cheese saying that they show “the camembert of time”. The idea of rot and decay is most evident in the gold watch on the left, which is swarmed by ants. Ants, a common motif in Dalí’s art are usually linked to decay and death. He set the scene in a desolate landscape that was likely inspired by the landscape of his homeland, the Catalan coast. The influence of the Catalan landscape also appears in another element of the painting: the artist inserts himself into the scene in the form of a strange fleshy creature in the center of the painting. According to Dalí, the self-portrait was based on a rock formation at Cap de Creus in northeast Catalonia. Some scholars have also drawn a parallel between the self-portrait and a section of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-garden-of-earthly-delights-1515-7][i]The Garden of Earthly Delights[/i][/url] (1510-1515) – on the right side of the left panel Bosch depicts rocks, bushes, and small animals that resemble Dalí’s profile with the prominent nose and long eyelashes. Similar versions of this self-portrait appear in other paintings by Dalí like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-great-masturbator-1929][i]The Great Masturbator[/i][/url] (1929).\n \nThe melting watch, one of Dalí’s most powerful and potent motifs, continued to play an important role in his art. Two decades after [i]The Persistence of Memory[/i], Dalí recreated his famous work in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-disintegration-of-the-persistence-of-memory][i]The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (1952-1954). As the title suggests, the painting shows the disintegration of the world depicted in the original painting, reflecting a world changed by the nuclear age. The painting showed Dalí’s growing interest in quantum physics: he added rectangular blocks that represent “the atomic power source” and missile-like objects that reference the atomic bomb. In the late stages of his career, Dalí also produced numerous sculptures of melting watches including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1980][i]The Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (ca. 1980), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/profile-of-time-1984][i]Profile of Time[/i][/url] (1977-1984), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/nobility-of-time-1984][i]Nobility of Time[/i][/url] (1977-1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/dance-of-time-i-1984][i]Dance of Time I[/i][/url] (1979-1984).\n \n[i]The Persistence of Memory[/i] was first shown in 1932 at the [i]Julien Levy Gallery[/i] in New York.

    "description": "There are two versions of The Dance, the first, painted in March of 1909, is the study for the second one, completed in 1910. The large work, painted along the lines of William Blake’s painting “Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing,” was painted along with its companion piece, Music, which depicts nudes playing music in a similar setting. The pieces were specially created for Russian businessman and art collector Sergei Shchukin, who was a long-time associate of Matisse’s. This painting is often recognized as a key point in the development of Matisse’s artwork, as well as in the development of modern painting. It is also often associated with “Dance of the Young Girls,” in The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky. ",

    "description": "Edward Hopper said that Nighthawks was inspired by \"a restaurant on New York's Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet,\" but the image, with its carefully constructed composition and lack of narrative, has a timeless quality that transcends its particular locale. One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. Reworked and parodied countless times, Nighthawks has become an icon of American culture.",

    "description": "The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up is an oil painting executed in 1839 by the English artist J. M. W. Turner. It depicts one of the last second-rate ships of the line which played a distinguished role in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the 98-gun ship HMS Temeraire, being towed by a paddle-wheel steam tug towards its final berth in Rotherhithe south east London in 1838 to be broken up for scrap. The painting hangs in the National Gallery, London, having been bequeathed to the nation by the artist in 1851. In 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Newbolt wrote a ballad titled The Fighting Temeraire, referencing the scenario depicted: \"And she's fading down the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting Téméraire.\" Turner himself presented the painting for display in 1839 accompanied by an altered excerpt from Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Mariners of England, reading: \"The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,/No longer owns her.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Turner came to paint this picture in 1839 he was at the height of his career, having exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, for 40 years. He was renowned for his highly atmospheric paintings in which he explored the subjects of the weather, the sea and the effects of light. He spent much of his life near the River Thames estuary and did many paintings of ships and waterside scenes, both in watercolour and in oils. Turner frequently made small sketches and then worked them into finished paintings in the studio. He was present when this ship was towed and made some sketches of it. However, he appears to have used some license in the finished painting, which has taken on symbolic meaning. The painting is of a ship being towed away for scrap. It is highly metaphorical as the ship has performed great service for its country and is now being removed from society.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this painting is unusual in that the most significant object, the old warship, is positioned well to the left of the painting, where it rises in stately splendour and almost ghostlike colours against a triangle of blue sky and rising mist that throws it into relief. The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened tugboat with its tall smokestack, which scurries across the still surface of the river \"like a water beetle\".\r\n\r\nTurner has used the triangle of blue to frame a second triangle of masted ships, which progressively decrease in size as they become more distant. Temeraire and tugboat have passed a small river craft with its gaff rigged sail barely catching a breeze. Beyond this a square-rigger drifts, with every bit of sail extended. Another small craft shows as a patch of white farther down the river. In the far distance, beyond the second tugboat which makes its way towards them, a three-masted ship rides at anchor. The becalmed sailing vessels show the obsolescence of sail. On the opposite side of the painting to Temeraire, and exactly the same distance from the frame as the ship's main mast, the sun sets above the estuary, its rays extending into the clouds above it, and across the surface of the water. The flaming red of the clouds is reflected in the river. It exactly repeats the colour of the smoke which pours from the funnel of the tugboat. The sun setting symbolises the end of an epoch in the history of the British Royal Navy. The demise of heroic strength is the subject of the painting, and it has been suggested that the ship stands for the artist himself, with an accomplished and glorious past but now contemplating his mortality. Turner called the work his \"darling\", which may have been due to its beauty, or his identification with the subject.",
